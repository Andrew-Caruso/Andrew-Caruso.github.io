<h3>Education</h3> 
<p>University of California, Riverside - Physics</p>
<p>September 2019 - June 2023</p>
<p>Currently pursuing a Physics Bachelor's of Science Degree, standard track</p>

<h3>Experience</h3> 
<h4>UCR, Undergraduate Research - Undergraduate Researcher</h4>
<p>Winter 2020 - Winter 2021</p>
<ul> 
<li> Member of an undergraduate team with Professor Owen Long on experimental particle physics research (proton-proton collisions and supersymmetry). </li> 
<li> Furthered skills and experience utilizing C++ along with ROOT software from CERN and text editors (Emacs and VIM). </li> 
<li>
    At the beginning of sophomore year in my undergraduate studies, I began experimental particle research with Professor Owen Long regarding r-parity violation supersymmetry (RPV SUSY) and supersymmetric top quark (stop squark) decays. For several months I had to expand my C++ program skills, learn how to plot using ROOT software from the Conseil Européen pour la Recherche Nucléaire (CERN), and use text editors such as VIM and emacs for the first time. Coincidentally, once I was comfortable with the software and able to produce graphs of the signal and background data, two other undergraduate students joined the group. We were tasked in finding a method to separate the signal from the top quark pair production background. Although we were not making sufficient progress with the task, I developed many computing skills necessary for research. I therefore decided to pursue a different research opportunity.

<h4>UCR, Undergraduate Research - Undergraduate Researcher</h4>
<p>Winter 2021 - Present</p>
<ul>
<li>Member of an undergraduate team working with Professor Anson D’Aloisio on theoretical cosmology (reionization and dark matter). </li>
<li> Gained UNIX and Python experience </li> 
<li>
    I started research in my junior year with Professor Anson D’Aloisio on theoretical cosmology, particularly regarding the reionization epoch. I worked alongside another undergraduate student under the supervision of a graduate student and the professor. Our first project was simply finding the halo mass function from simulated data, which we both successfully accomplished. The second task we worked on was to find a relation between the transmissivity and lyman alpha emitters (LAEs) density. Rather we were replicating results acquired by Holly Christenson, who found a negative correlation between opacity of quasar sightlines and density of LAEs. We took the first most transmissive quasar sightlines from another set of simulated data at redshift ~6 and plotted a cut of the two LAE distributions as scatter plots. This also utilized a supercomputer from San Diego Computer Center called Expanse, which we had to learn how to use for the first time. This required using the command line (particularly Unix OS) and python skills as well as running and controlling jobs on Expanse. After success in creating the plots, we were to find the radial surface density using the first 1000 most transmissive quasar sightlines, however, the other undergraduate graduated while I was fortunate enough to have an internship for the recent summer. Thus I momentarily paused the research in order to fully experience the summer internship.

<h4>Palomar Health, Pathmaker Internship - Intern</h4>
<p>July 2017 - August 2019</p>
<ul> 
<li>Assisted registered nurses and certified nursing assistants with patient care.</li>
<li>Approximately 300 hour commitment</li> 
<li>
    During my time in highschool, I was determined to enter the medical field. I volunteered weekly at a hospital through the Palomar Health Pathmaker internship and worked alongside many registered nurses (RNs), certified nursing assistants (CNAs), and physical therapists as well as college level interns providing patient care in a variety of departments. Even my academics in high school were geared towards a medical career, including an immunology course which I greatly enjoyed. At one point I was thinking of becoming a physician assistant (PA) and even interviewed and shadowed a PA.

<h4>CERN Summer Student Programme - Intern</h4>
<p>June 2022 - August 22</p>
<ul>
<li>9 week summer internship via the International Research Experience for Students (IRES) at CERN, funded by the National Science Foundation.</li>
<li>NA62 Experiment (kaon factory) at CERN</li>
<li>Created a python (computer language) program to simulate the CEDAR (differential cherenkov radiation counter) in the NA62 experiment.</li>
<li> <a href="https://cds.cern.ch/record/2824828">CERN Technical Report</a> </li>
<li> <a href="https://insideucr.ucr.edu/stories/2022/08/24/summer-particle-physics">UCR Article on my CERN Internship Experience</a> </li>

    I had the opportunity to be a part of the International Research Experience for Students (IRES) at CERN internship and the CERN summer student programme for the 2022 summer, coordinated by Professor Philip Rubin. I worked with a postdoctoral researcher, Dr. Chris Parkinson, in the NA62 experiment at CERN, which involves a proton beam collision from the super proton synchrotron (SPS) into a fixed beryllium target in order to search for rare kaon decays. My supervisor, Dr. Parkinson wanted me to simulate the differential Cherenkov radiation counter (CEDAR) near the upstream end of the experiment, in order for him to know how to quickly adjust the components of the CEDAR when the gas, originally nitrogen gas, is changed to hydrogen gas in order to improve efficiency. Essentially, a secondary beam from the upstream collision primarily consists of positive kaons, positive pions, and protons, which travel through the gas-filled CEDAR. Because these charged particles are superluminal within the gas medium, they produce cherenkov radiation off the beam axis and this light is reflected by a spherical mirror, corrected, passed through the ring-like aperture of a diaphragm to filter the out light from other particles save for the kaons and then reflected again into a kaon detector, KTAG, which consists of multipliers to convert the light into a electrical signal. Ultimately the CEDAR/KTAG identifies kaons entering the NA62 experiment at the beginning. I used my previous python skills to build a stand-alone program to replicate expected results by starting with a simplified model of the CEDAR and  implementing further complexity into the simulation over time. I then created one technical report at the end of the project, which was made available to other summer students, CERN staff, and the general public on the CERN Document Server. Hopefully, the simulation will be of great use to Dr. Parkison who will use it for the test beam with a hydrogen gas filled CEDAR.

<h3>Undergraduate Academics</h3>
<p> 
I have taken lower division introductory physics, a introductory computer science course (in C++), upper division classical mechanics, thermal physics, electromagnetism, and quantum mechanics. 
Since I am on a standard track in the physics major I have taken a variety of elective physics courses including astrophysics, cosmology, energy and the enviroment, introduction to particle physics, and computational physics.
I am currently taking graduate level quantum mechanics to enhance my self study of quantum field theory as well as graduate methods of theoretical physics and upper division nuclear physics 
Lastly, I am in good standing academically with a cumulative GPA of 3.8
</p>


<h3>Research Interests</h3>
<p>
    I am intrigued by quantum mechanics and particle physics but particularly theoretical particle physics. I am open to a variety of subfields in phenomenology and fundemental theory including dark matter, neutrinos, QFT, CFT, holography, gravity (both in general relativity and quantum mechanics), black holes, and QCD to name a few.
</p> 


<h3>Recreational Activities</h3>
<p>I enjoy working out be it kettlebells or running and trying to cook health meals. In terms of games, I play an uncommon boardgame called hnefatafl, which is a cross between chess and checkers. It is simply a type of talf or old viking table game. I also enjoy a variety of music, especially movie and video game soundtracks. If I had more time I would contiue doing a martial art called Aikido, which I spent years doing during my high school ages.</p>
