<h3>Awards</h3>
<p>Dean's Honors List for Winter 2020</p>
<p>Dean's Honors List for Fall 2020</p>
<p>R. Stephen White Endowment Award - Outstanding 3rd year Undergraduate Student for Winter 2022</p>

<h3>Skills</h3>
<p>Experience with programming languages: C++, UNIX, Latex  and JSON; text editors: Emacs and VIM; and softwares: Wolfram Mathematica and ROOT from CERN.</p>

<h3>Undergraduate Academics</h3>
<p>I have taken lower division introductory physics, a introductory computer science course (in C++), upper division classical mechanics, thermal physics, electromagnetism, and quantum mechanics.</p>
<p>Since I am on a standard track in the physics major I have taken a variety of electic physics courses including astrophysics, cosmology, energy and the enviroment, introduction to particle physics, and computational physics.</p>
<p> I am currently taking graduate level quantum mechanics to enhance my self study of quantum field theory as well as graduate methods of theoretical physics and upper division nuclear physics</p>
<p>Lastly, I am in good standing academically with a cumulative GPA of 3.8</p>


<h3>Research Interests</h3>
<p>I am intrigued by quantum mechanics and particle physics but particularly theoretical particle physics. I am open to a variety of subfields in phenomenology and fundemental theory.</p> 

<h3>Recreational Activities</h3>
<p>I enjoy working out be it kettlebells or running and trying to cook health meals. In terms of games, I play an uncommon boardgame called hnefatafl, which is a cross between chess and checkers. It is simply a type of talf or old viking table game. I also enjoy a variety of music, especially movie and video game soundtracks. If I had more time I would contiue doing a martial art called Aikido, which I spent years doing during my high school ages.</p>
