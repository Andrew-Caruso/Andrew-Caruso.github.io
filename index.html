<h3>Education</h3> 
<p>University of California, Riverside - Physics</p>
<p>September 2019 - June 2023</p>
<p>Currently pursuing a Physics Bachelor's of Science Degree, standard track</p>

<h3>Experience</h3> 
<h4>UCR, Undergraduate Research - Undergraduate Researcher</h4>
<p>Winter 2020 - Winter 2021</p>
<ul> 
<li> Member of an undergraduate team with Professor Owen Long on experimental particle physics research (proton-proton collisions and supersymmetry). </li> 
<li> Furthered skills and experience utilizing C++ along with ROOT software from CERN and text editors (Emacs and VIM). </li> 
<li>
    In my sophomore year, I did experimental particle physics research with Professor Owen Long regarding R-parity violation supersymmetry and supersymmetric top quark decays. My project was to find a new way to distinguish the top/anti-top quark background from a hypothetical neutralino signal as part of an effort to assess the effectiveness of machine learning. This was important for the analysis of data from the Large Hadron Collider in search for the hypothetical neutralino, given the window for the supersymmetric model was being highly constrained while no particles were being found. Evidence for the supersymmetric model, as an extension to the Standard Model in which every fermion has a corresponding boson and vice versa, would solve several mysteries in the Standard Model if a supersymmetric particle was found. This was my induction into high energy physics in terms of beyond the Standard Model and collider physics.

<h4>UCR, Undergraduate Research - Undergraduate Researcher</h4>
<p>Winter 2021 - Present</p>
<ul>
<li>Member of an undergraduate team working with Professor Anson D’Aloisio on theoretical cosmology (reionization and dark matter). </li>
<li> Gained UNIX and Python experience </li> 
<li>
    Starting in my junior year, I did theoretical cosmological research with Professor Anson D’Aloisio on the reionization epoch. I found the dark matter halo mass function from simulated data and reproduced plots relating the transmissivity of quasar sightlines to the density of lyman alpha emitters. This utilized Expanse, a supercomputer from the San Diego Supercomputer Center, Unix, and Python programming. This research experience allowed me to expand my knowledge regarding the reionization epoch and computational skills which can be particularly useful in astrophysics or cosmological research but also transferable to other fields, such as particle physics. Currently, I am starting a new project regarding a large AI assisted simulation, in which I will create a data analysis program for the 21 cm radiation to replicate intergalactic neural hydrogen regions. This will lead to a paper for my senior thesis by the end of my undergraduate studies. The research will help push forward the theoretical efforts to better simulate the universe during the reionization epoch, which is still currently being explored to understand the formation of the first galaxies and stars.

<h4>Palomar Health, Pathmaker Internship - Intern</h4>
<p>July 2017 - August 2019</p>
<ul> 
<li>Assisted registered nurses and certified nursing assistants with patient care.</li>
<li>Approximately 300 hour commitment</li> 
<li>
    During my time in high school, I was determined to enter the medical field. I volunteered weekly at a hospital through the Palomar Health Pathmaker internship and worked alongside many registered nurses (RNs), certified nursing assistants (CNAs), and physical therapists as well as college-level interns providing patient care in a variety of departments. Even my academics in high school were geared towards a medical career, including an immunology course that I greatly enjoyed. At one point I was thinking of becoming a physician assistant (PA) and even interviewed and shadowed a PA.

</ul> 
<h4>CERN Summer Student Programme - Intern</h4>
<p>June 2022 - August 2022</p>
<ul>
<li>9 week summer internship via the International Research Experience for Students (IRES) at CERN, funded by the National Science Foundation.</li>
<li>NA62 Experiment (kaon factory) at CERN</li>
<li>Created a python (computer language) program to simulate the CEDAR (differential cherenkov radiation counter) in the NA62 experiment.</li>
<li> <a href="https://cds.cern.ch/record/2824828">CERN Technical Report</a> </li>
<li> <a href="https://insideucr.ucr.edu/stories/2022/08/24/summer-particle-physics">UCR Article on my CERN Internship Experience</a> </li>
<li>
    This summer I was part of the International Research Experience for Students (IRES) at CERN, coordinated by Professor Philip Rubin from George Mason University. I worked with a postdoctoral researcher, Dr. Chris Parkinson, on the NA62 experiment, which searches for rare kaon decays from proton collisions with a fixed beryllium target. I created a standalone Python program to simulate the differential Cherenkov radiation counter (CEDAR) at the upstream end of the experiment. The CEDAR identifies charged particles by detecting their Cherenkov radiation when they accelerate through nitrogen gas. The purpose was to know how to quickly adjust the components of the CEDAR when the gas is changed to hydrogen gas to potentially improve the efficiency of kaon identification. This will allow the NA62 experiment to better examine rare kaon decays in order to search for lepton flavor/number violations and new particles, such as dark photons. At the end of the internship, I created a technical report which was made available to other CERN staff and the general public on the CERN Document Server.

<h3>Awards</h3>
<p>Dean's Honors List for Winter 2020</p>
<p>Dean's Honors List for Fall 2020</p>
<p>R. Stephen White Endowment Award - Outstanding 3rd year Undergraduate Student for Winter 2022</p>

<h3>Skills</h3>
<p>Experience with programming languages: C++, UNIX, Latex  and JSON; text editors: Emacs and VIM; and softwares: Wolfram Mathematica and ROOT from CERN.</p>

<h3>Undergraduate Academics</h3>
<p> 
I have taken lower division introductory physics, a introductory computer science course (in C++), upper division classical mechanics, thermal physics, electromagnetism, and quantum mechanics. 
Since I am on a standard track in the physics major I have taken a variety of elective physics courses including astrophysics, cosmology, energy and the enviroment, introduction to particle physics, and computational physics.
I am currently taking graduate level quantum mechanics to enhance my self study of quantum field theory as well as graduate methods of theoretical physics and upper division nuclear physics 
Lastly, I am in good standing academically with a cumulative GPA of 3.8
</p>


<h3>Research Interests</h3>
<p>
    I am intrigued by quantum mechanics and particle physics but particularly theoretical particle physics. I am open to a variety of subfields in phenomenology and fundemental theory including dark matter, neutrinos, QFT, CFT, holography, gravity (both in general relativity and quantum mechanics), black holes, and QCD to name a few.
</p> 


<h3>Recreational Activities</h3>
<p>I enjoy working out (via kettlebells or running) and trying to cook healthy meals. In terms of games, I play an uncommon boardgame called hnefatafl, which is a cross between chess and checkers. It is simply a type of talf or old viking table game. I also enjoy a variety of music, especially movie and video game soundtracks. If I had more time I would contiue doing a martial art called Aikido, which I spent years doing during high school.</p>
